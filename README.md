# Assignment 4: Simple Linear Regression from Scratch

This project implements Simple Linear Regression using two optimization methods:
- Ordinary Least Squares (Closed-form)
- Gradient Descent (Iterative)

## Features
- Synthetic data generation with a linear relationship and Gaussian noise
- Manual implementation of OLS and Gradient Descent (no scikit-learn)
- Evaluation using five metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE, R², Adjusted R²
- Visualization using Matplotlib

## File Structure
- `Assignment 4.py`: Main script for data generation, model training, evaluation, and plotting
- `placement.csv`: (Not used in this assignment, but present in the workspace)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python "Assignment 4.py"
   ```

## Notes
- Do **not** use scikit-learn for modeling or metrics.
- You may use NumPy for calculations and Matplotlib for plotting.
