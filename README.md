# ML Lab Assignments

This repository contains solutions to various Machine Learning lab assignments. Each assignment demonstrates a different concept or technique in machine learning, implemented from scratch or using basic libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib). No scikit-learn is used for modeling unless specified.

## Contents

- **Assignment 1.py**: [Add a brief description of Assignment 1 here.]
- **Assignment 2.py**: [Add a brief description of Assignment 2 here.]
- **Assignment 3.py**: [Add a brief description of Assignment 3 here.]
- **Assignment 4.py**: Simple Linear Regression from scratch using Ordinary Least Squares and Gradient Descent, with evaluation metrics and visualization.
- **placement.csv**: Dataset used in one or more assignments (see respective scripts for details).

## General Instructions
- All code is written in Python 3.
- Required libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib (install via `pip install numpy matplotlib`).
- Run scripts directly using:
  ```bash
  python "Assignment X.py"
  ```
  Replace `X` with the assignment number.
